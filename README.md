# Strip Whitespace On Save

TextMate 2 bundle: Strips trailing whitespace from current document when saving. Works nicely with my [Save On Focus Lost bundle](https://github.com/bomberstudios/Save-On-Focus-Lost.tmbundle). If you need whitespace highlighting, check the superb [Whitespace bundle by Mads Hartmann](http://mads379.github.com/posts/whitespace-tmbundle).

## Installation

- Clone the git repo to  `~/Library/Application Support/TextMate/Managed/Bundles`
- Relaunch TextMate 2

## Note

You need to be using a recent build. Open Preferences Â» Software Update and **ALT-click the "Check Now"** button to get the most recent nightly build (this will grab a latest version than the one you get by just clicking the button).


Enjoy it!
