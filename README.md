# Strip Whitespace On Save

TextMate 2 bundle: Strips trailing whitespace from current document when saving. Works nicely with my [Save On Focus Lost bundle](https://github.com/bomberstudios/Save-On-Focus-Lost.tmbundle). If you need whitespace highlighting, check the superb [Whitespace bundle by Mads Hartmann](http://mads379.github.com/posts/whitespace-tmbundle). If you happen to need new lines at EOF, then check Mike Szyndel's [Ensure New Line at the EOF bundle](https://github.com/hajder/Ensure-New-Line-at-the-EOF.tmbundle), which is based on mine.

## Installation

- Clone the git repo to  `~/Library/Application Support/Avian/Bundles`
- Relaunch TextMate 2

## Notes

**You need to be using at least TextMate version 2.0.0-alpha.9317**. Open Preferences Â» Software Update and **ALT-click the "Check Now"** button to get the most recent nightly build (this will grab a latest version than the one you get by just clicking the button).

Enjoy it!
